        <h1>One Soul: A Silent Love</h1>
        <p>On 2019, when I was in 4th class, I fell in love with a girl whose name is _? She was my junior. We were from the same school and used to go in the same vehicle. But I couldn’t express my feelings.</p>
        <p>Then COVID-19 came and the lockdown closed everything, including school. Later, I joined a tuition class, and by fate, she joined too. Although her timing was different, I got a glimpse of her sometimes.</p>
        <p>Somehow, I got her number and messaged her one day. We had a small conversation, but then she said goodbye. Slowly we talked a little more. Later I found out she changed schools, which hurt, but I accepted it.</p>
        <p>In 7th class, I joined a hostel. After a month, during summer holidays, she called me. I was shocked and happy to know she joined the same school and even the same section, 7 'B'. That day, we talked for 30 minutes on call.</p>
        <p>Back in school, she sat on the first bench. On the first day, she couldn’t fill the address in her ID card form, so the sir sent me to help her. That was the first time I stood beside her and helped.</p>
        <p>Later, boys and girls were separated in school. During winter vacation, I finally proposed to her without thinking much. She refused and blocked me. I wanted to talk, but didn’t know what to say.</p>
        <p>In 8th class, during Diwali vacation, we had a small talk again. After that, she joined hostel, and we never spoke again. I’ve tried many times, but she doesn’t want to talk. I don’t know why, but I respect her choice.</p>
        <p>This year, during Holi, I managed to put color on her. At least now, I see her sometimes in school, and that brings happiness. But this is our final year—10th board exams in 2026. Who knows where life will take us next?</p>
        <p>I just hope she scores well and stays happy wherever she goes. But truly, I love her a lot. I don’t want to lose her. Whatever happens, I hope it’s for the best.</p>
